Hi there, I'm Ardi 

Python Developer | Creative Technologist | Designer at Heart

I’ve always been drawn to making ideas real through code.  
For me, programming isn’t just technical—it’s a way to design, experiment, and create.  

I spend most of my time writing Python and building projects, but I also explore the creative side of tech:  
UI/UX and digital design  
3D modeling & interactive visuals  
Prototyping ideas that blur the line between art and code
